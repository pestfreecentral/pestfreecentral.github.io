<p>In recommendation to the principle of integrating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on widened to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
