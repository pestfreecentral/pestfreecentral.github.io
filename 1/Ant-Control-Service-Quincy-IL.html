<p>If you wind up hiring a pest-control service, look around-- there are big differences in quality, and you don't have to pay more for good service. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic approach towards pest threat management by utilising proactive control approaches. Insecticides are classified in numerous ways, and it is very important to be familiar with these categories so that the choice of an insecticide is based upon more than just how well it controls the pest.</p>

If all other incorporated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Generally, the primary goal of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally developed for farming pest management, IPM programs are now established to incorporate illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management goals of sites such as commercial and residential structures, yard and turf locations, and house and neighborhood gardens.</p>
