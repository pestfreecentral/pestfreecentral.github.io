<h3>The Basics of Green Pest Control Arnaudville LA</h3>
<p>The term "integrated" was therefore associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>A specific pest can be controlled by particular choices, however they may not all be offered in a particular place, for a particular crop, or within the available monetary means. IPM involves utilizing the best mix of cultural, chemical and biological measures for specific circumstances, including plant biotechnology as appropriate. This planning includes attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest problems might be, picking crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, choosing tillage systems that will reduce expected pest damage while giving the crop the greatest yield capacity.</p>
