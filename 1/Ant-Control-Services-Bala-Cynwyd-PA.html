<p>This might consist of using several pesticides with various modes of action. Trap crops are planted to draw in and hold pest insects where they can be managed more efficiently and prevent or reduce their movement onto important crops. Schedules are utilized to classify pesticides and to control the schedule of a product to the public. Termites require moisture for their survival, thus damp walls, leakage and water seepage are like open invites for them.</p>
<p>Some likewise recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM might occur, even yearly management of a continuous pest could be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).

Constant training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for establishment of reliable and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>

Do not battle a bed bug battle by yourself.</p>
