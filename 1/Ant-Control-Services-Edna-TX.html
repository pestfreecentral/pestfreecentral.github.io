<p>Cockroaches are among homeowners' most significant fears - the extremely word generates sensations of anxiety and disgust. At the same time, it is also based on semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are warded off or discouraged far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide problems are caused by a little number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
