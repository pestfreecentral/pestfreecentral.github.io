Sustainable cultivation needs crops to be resistant to illness and infestations, and the environment in which they are grown requirements to have a capacity to fix itself.</p>
<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, yard, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming a threat.
