<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable technique that incorporates practices for the economic avoidance and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Unique preventative measures need to be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic technique to pest control.</p>
<p>This approach refers to the use of a variety of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>The application of insect pest control is the largest in the commercial & commercial sector due to the increasing need for professional pest control options, specifically for food manufacturing and hospitality sectors, to preserve a hygienic environment for the control of cockroaches, flies, mosquitoes, and insects. Provide us a try to see our pest control Austin services in action.</p>
<p>Usually, the main goal of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially established for farming pest management, IPM programmes are now established to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management objectives of sites such as industrial and residential structures, yard and grass locations, and home and community gardens.</p>
