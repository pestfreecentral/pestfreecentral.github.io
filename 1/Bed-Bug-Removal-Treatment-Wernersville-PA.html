Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic technique towards pest risk management by using proactive control approaches.

<p>They must also be detail-oriented in handling pesticides and chemicals that are potentially damaging. Find out more about Rentokil PCI's options for typical pests in companies and homes. The 4 major problems come across with traditional pesticides are poisonous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy that avoids pest damage with minimum unfavorable effect on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be extremely reliable in causing significant reductions in pest populations in specific scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural opponents or conserving natural opponent populations by offering havens or preventing practices that damage them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
