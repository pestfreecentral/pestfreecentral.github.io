As soon as the committee comprehends the types of pests that may enter the structure and possibly damage collection products, the next action is to set up an IPPM program to deal with the identified needs.</p>
<p>Much like us, pests need food, water, and shelter to endure, and if they can't find these in your home, it's most likely they'll go elsewhere. If they can not enter it, pests can not make it through without food and will not infest a structure.
