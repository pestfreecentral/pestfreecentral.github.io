<p>For some tasks, pest control workers use a mix of pest management methods, a practice called integrated pest management. The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, diseases, and weeds, though disputed by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the climax of pest control.</p>

For pest control, temperature level needs to be 68 ° F or lower, and relative humidity must be kept below an optimum of 70%; however, keeping climate conditions advised for the preservation of books and paper will help to control insect populations. For example, feeding activities of particular caterpillars on the leaves of tomatoes and potatoes cause a systemic production of protease inhibitors revealed throughout the plant that disrupt the food digestion procedure and feeding habits of insects (36 ).</p>

The term "IPM," under numerous authors have promoted for the principle of including, the complete selection of pest management practices with production objectives in an overall systemic technique. These control approaches can be cost-effective and extremely effective and present little to no danger to people or the environment.</p>
