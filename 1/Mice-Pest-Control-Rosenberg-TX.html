Integrated Pest Management, or IPM, is a method to fixing pest issues by applying our knowledge about pests to prevent them from harming crops, harming animals, infesting buildings or otherwise interfering with our income or pleasure of life.</p>
<p>For example, management of the Soybean aphid includes entomologists who study the pest and their damage to soybean, agronomists that determine crop stage which are most vulnerable to soybean aphid damage, plant pathologists who study the infections sent by aphid feeding, and soil researchers who study the aphids interaction with nutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>Consider alternative approaches (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a building. Recent missions for reliable, safe, and lasting pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily towards advancement of new and better products with which to change conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
