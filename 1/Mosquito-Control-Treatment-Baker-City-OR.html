The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>This approach describes the use of a variety of physical or mechanical techniques for pest exemption, trapping (in many cases comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
