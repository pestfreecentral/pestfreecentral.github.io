The benefit of the fogging pest control approach is that it's thought about to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned. Cultural practices - rely on a strategy to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by disrupting their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or location by both grownups and immatures.</p>
