D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the best for other organisms and for soil, water, and air quality; usage pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any variety of factors, including those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural sections, compromising the efficiency of natural enemies often allows potential pest organisms to experience essentially uncontrolled population growth and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
