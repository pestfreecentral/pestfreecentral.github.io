Sustainable growing needs crops to be resistant to invasions and illness, and the environment in which they are grown needs to have a capability to repair itself.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been regularly using much of these IPM methods for decades or perhaps generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in areas prone to pests, or using tolerant or resistant ranges.
