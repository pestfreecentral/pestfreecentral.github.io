<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, place within the greenhouse, and the number of plants examined. It's possible that the duplicated usage of pesticides might be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits adjust for changes in market prices, phase of crop development, expense of pesticides, etc., but in truth most are based upon fixed problem or damage levels.</p>
