<p>A method that involves the use of pest-resistant and pest-tolerant cultivars established through conventional breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that decrease the plant's beauty or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
