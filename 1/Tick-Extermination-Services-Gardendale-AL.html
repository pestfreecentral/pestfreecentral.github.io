Guidelines and legislation relating to the usage, permitted techniques of application and the storage conditions of chemicals and pesticides vary from country to nation, typically being enacted laws by each state of area.

<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly attain levels at which damage is caused hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
