<p>The entryway holes of some pest are smaller sized than can be seen by the human eye, so there may be no noticeable damage to product packaging including pests. Pests interact with each other, the crop, and the environment. Biological controls-- Natural biological processes and materials can supply control, with acceptable ecological effect, and frequently at lower cost.</p>
<p>For example, management of the Soybean aphid includes entomologists who study the pest and their damage to soybean, agronomists that determine crop stage which are most vulnerable to soybean aphid damage, plant pathologists who study the viruses transferred by aphid feeding, and soil scientists who study the aphids interaction with nutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>These unidentified or improperly understood potential risks argue for additional levels of security including direct exposures to multiple pesticides, at home, at school and in the diet; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and personal care items; and the basic difficulty in attributing persistent diseases to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses a lot of the very same concepts as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
