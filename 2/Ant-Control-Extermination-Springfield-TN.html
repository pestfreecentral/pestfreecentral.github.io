<p>Pest management requires a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in limited locations.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al.
