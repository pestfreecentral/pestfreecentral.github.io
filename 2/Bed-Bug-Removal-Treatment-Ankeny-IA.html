We have actually been in business since 1947, which suggests we understand the pests that are common to this area and have the know-how and tools to remove them. To deplore an effective IPM program, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host range, distribution, movement, and basic biology will need to be investigated.</p>
<p>As the federal authority under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA), the PMRA establishes pest management policies and standards; promotes sustainable pest management; aims to improve the regulative process to increase effectiveness; implements compliance with the PCPA; and, distributes pest management information to the general public and crucial stakeholders.</p>
