<p>The behavior of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disruption methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

Where the danger of resistance versus a plant defense measure is understood and where the level of damaging organisms requires duplicated application of pesticides to the crops, offered anti-resistance strategies must be used to preserve the effectiveness of the products.</p>
<p>Throughout multiple outreach conferences and field tours organized solely for the general public in Southern California throughout the previous couple of years, it appeared that a majority was not aware of farming systems, had misconstruing about sustainable agriculture, and thought that natural food is pesticide-free (Dara personal observations and unpublished survey information).</p>
<p>Environmentally safe: Numerous biological control representatives are ecological specialists. Guidelines and legislation concerning the usage, allowed techniques of application and the storage conditions of pesticides and chemicals vary from country to country, frequently being enacted laws by each state of territory. Research and outreach are an essential part of the IPM model to recognize and expect pest problems, develop preventive and alleviative strategies, and successfully share the information through standard and modern interaction tools and techniques.</p>
