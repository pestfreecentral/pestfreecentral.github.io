<p>We take a look at the huge picture and focus on long term avoidance of pests by performing pre-treatment examinations, determining conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, placement of monitoring gadgets, sanitation recommendations, prevention & exclusion, and applying pesticides in a strategic and safe way are all examples of how Mills PM executes the practices of IPM.</p>
