Integrated pest management was conceived during the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget results, and financial waste were clearly apparent (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>Because the term IPM has actually been coopted by the chemical industry to mean practically anything a practitioner wants it to mean, Beyond Pesticides has actually embraced the expression Ecological Pest Management."
