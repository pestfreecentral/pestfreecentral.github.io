<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is deemed a ecologically benign and affordable  pest control strategy preferably fit for both small and large farmers around the world. When termites have actually gone into a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.
