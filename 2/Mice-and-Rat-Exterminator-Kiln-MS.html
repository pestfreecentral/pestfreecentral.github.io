<p>The decision of the right cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides toxic to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural opponents than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life phases.</p>
