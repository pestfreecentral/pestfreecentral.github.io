<p>The term "incorporated" was hence associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied just after routine tracking suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control steps.</p>
<p>Using information about pests' biology and routines, in addition to a toolbox of pest management methods, pest control employees locate, recognize, and get rid of pests. However since these "sex" traps attract primarily male insects, they aren't really efficient controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest. A routine tracking program is the basis of IPM decision making, regardless of the control strategies utilized.</p>
