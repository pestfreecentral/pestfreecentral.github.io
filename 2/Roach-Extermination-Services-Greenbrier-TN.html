<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Directive on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are needed to consider the concepts of IPM before making use of chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of controlling pests such as insects and mites by utilizing other organisms 8 It depends on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but generally likewise involves an active human management role.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is triggered therefore ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of large, pricey homes, so pest control costs might be higher there because there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
