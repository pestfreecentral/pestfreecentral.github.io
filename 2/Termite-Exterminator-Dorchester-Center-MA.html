Biopesticides are typically compatible with natural enemies, however there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of logical and ethical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ).

A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of qualified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>
