<p>Aids on pesticides were reduced from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and removed entirely by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - implies a typical way of damaging pests as it takes place in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the requirement to handle substantial populations that might cause crop damage. Safety issues and environmental disruptions continue to take place (Wright, 1996 ), and there are renewed appeals for reliable, safe, and economically acceptable alternatives (Benbrook, 1996 ). Synthetic chemical pesticides are the most commonly used approach of pest control.</p>
<p>It is found in some cases that we need pest control only in a specific location and not all over. Our online courses include Crop Pest Diagnostics and Management, along with the first-ever web-based sanitary and phytosanitary procedures curriculum (sponsored by USAID). Integrated pest management needs an understanding of the ecology of the cropping system, consisting of that of the pests, their natural enemies, and the surrounding environment.</p>
