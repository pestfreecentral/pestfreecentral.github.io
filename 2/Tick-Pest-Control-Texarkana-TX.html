<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
