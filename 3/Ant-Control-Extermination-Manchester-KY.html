<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>This method refers to making use of a variety of mechanical or physical techniques for pest exclusion, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
