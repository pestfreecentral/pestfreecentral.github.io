A single finding of any pest in a storage facility during an audit can suggest a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your valuables with hazardous chemicals, destroy the air quality in your home or business, potentially contaminate food and other perishables, and only eliminates pests at the surface of the problem.</p>
