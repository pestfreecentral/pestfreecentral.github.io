	<meta name="description" content="Pest Control Companies in Poplarville MS - The Thermacell Radius Zone Mosquito Repellent Gen 2.0 is the most convenient, easy-to-use spatial repellent we found, and it's nearly as good at stopping mosquitoes from bothering you as a full application of a spray repellent Compared with similar designs, the Radius is easier to refill and recharge, more efficient with its use of repellent, and more convenient to live with, and it doesn't present the hazards that some other options do. It won't stop every single mosquito from getting you, its coverage area is limited, and it loses efficacy in windy conditions—but all spatial repellents share those flaws.">
