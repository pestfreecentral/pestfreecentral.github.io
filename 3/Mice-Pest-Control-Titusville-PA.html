<p>It is also evident from many discussions with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management seen as rotating pesticides among various mode of action groups is frequently viewed as IPM, although resistance management is only a part of IPM. Pest control is the regulation or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that affects adversely on human activities.</p>
<p>As a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to handle the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming a danger. Since IPM is an intricate pest control process, not simply a series of practices, it is difficult to utilize one IPM definition for all foods and all areas of the nation.
