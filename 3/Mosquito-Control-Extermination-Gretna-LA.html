If so, an application of a nonselective insecticide could kill them, permitting the pest population to rebound uninhibited by parasites and predators, which may have been supplying significant control. The pest control market is just beginning to comprehend the opportunities to enhance our business with mobile and social technology-- but the possibilities are unlimited.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are used only when needed and in combination with other methods for more efficient, long-lasting control. The benefits of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, since they work with other pest management methods, specifically biological control.
