<p>Generate names for your pest control business below. The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies.

<p>A method that involves making use of pest-resistant and pest-tolerant cultivars established through standard breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ).
