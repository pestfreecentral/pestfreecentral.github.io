<p>Termites consume furniture, papers, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, therefore causing enormous damage within simply a couple of months. This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and organisations to inspect for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes presenting natural opponents from a pest's native variety into a new area where native natural enemies do not provide control.</p>
