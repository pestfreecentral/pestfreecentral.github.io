<p>Mission Declaration: The mission of Mosquito Control is to offer Leon County homeowners with environmentally sound and reliable mosquito control services. Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to fight aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals should be utilized only as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological methods have been attempted and shown inadequate.
