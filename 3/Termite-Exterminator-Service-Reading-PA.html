Predators eliminate their prey that damages crops, for example, ladybugs reduce aphid numbers. In many cases release of natural enemies even prior to the pest is present is possible, or needed for optimum effectiveness. The initial treatment consists of assessments, extermination of existing pests and boundary outside treatments.</p>
