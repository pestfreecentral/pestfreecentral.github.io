<p>Neighborhood IPM practitioners work to recognize and correct pest-friendly conditions, removing access to food, water and harborage by enhancing sanitation, upkeep, exemption and landscape management practices. The cane toad is another case illustrating biological control failure in this regard when it refused to hunt the target types and became a pest itself.</p>
<p>Also, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the same area may influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control relates to non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the location tidy and totally free of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space in between the bottom of a door and the floor.</p>
